## Beehive Robotics TeamCode module

This is where our code is stored. The Deprecated/ folder is for files we no longer use, for reasons such as we decided to not use a mechanism.

We have made classes for each of our mechanisms, as well as driving. This makes our OpModes very clean and easy to read/edit. It makes our programming more Object-Oriented, so it is more robust.
